# hello-world

Howdy folks!

Shelby here.  I like industrial music, objectivest ethics and philosphy, country living, shooting and hunting, and I love my wife and kids!

I'm working independently on business intelligence via Power BI, and custom app development in the alternative investments/finance space.  I'm currently working on automation of backend data processing, and migrating from an excel based data process to a code and automation driven database model feeding Power BI, and yet to be created web applications.
